# Your Story

## About
Your Story is web application which aims to facilitates collaborative story-telling. Users create the first entry to the story and others can contribute to it by suggesting how the story should continue, or by upvoting other contributions.

Your Story was designed to focus on the narrative process. Each story entry combines text with images and various audio and visual effects. The application also includes sentiment analysis which is ran on each entry in the story to suggest suitable photos to pair.
